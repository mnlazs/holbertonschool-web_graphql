## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and Redis installed on your machine.

## How to Run a Redis Server on Your Machine

1. **Install Redis**: Download and install Redis from [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download).
2. **Start Redis Server**: Open a terminal and run the following command to start the Redis server:

   ```bash
   redis-server

### How to Run Simple Operations with the Redis Client
You can use the Redis CLI to perform simple operations. For example, to set a key and retrieve its value:

# Set a key
redis> SET mykey "Hello, Redis!"

# Get the value
redis> GET mykey

### How to Use a Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations
In your Node.js project, you can use the ioredis library to connect to a Redis server. Here's a basic example:

const Redis = require('ioredis');
const redis = new Redis();

(async () => {
  await redis.set('example_key', 'Hello, Redis with Node.js');
  const value = await redis.get('example_key');
  console.log(value); // Output: 'Hello, Redis with Node.js'
})();
